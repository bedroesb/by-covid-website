The Versatile Emerging infectious disease Observatory (VEO) has published its eighth report on mutations and variation in publicly shared SARS-CoV-2 raw sequencing data.

In the report, the VEO Consortium members summarise the mobilisation and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data submitted to the European COVID-19 Data Platform. The report puts the submitted data in the context of the VEO project, which aims to develop tools and data analytics for pandemic and outbreak preparedness.
