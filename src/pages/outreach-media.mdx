## Outreach

### Public

We will work with patient organisations and the broader public so that people are aware of the project and can provide feedback on it. In particular, we will be asking for feedback on the ethical, social and legal aspects of opening access to infectious disease data across Europe.

We will also produce materials such as infographics and cartoons on what FAIR data is (i.e. data that is **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**eusable). These materials will outline the work of the project, and show how making data FAIR will help us combat disease. The materials will also include a resource pack for high school teachers, to educate high school students about BY-COVID and FAIR data. We will publish a report on the effectiveness these public engagement activities.

<h3 class="mt-4">Funders</h3>

Showcasing the impact of the project to European funders is key to the continued investment in the infrastructure being developed by BY-COVID. We are planning two large stakeholder events to communicate the outputs of the project, and the value of open infectious disease data. These events will be aimed at funders and policy-makers, including the European Commission, national EOSC (European Open Science Cloud) representatives, and relevant EU agencies.
