We appreciate people have different preferences and abilities when using websites. We have tried to make the site easy to use and understand, no matter what technology or browsing method you are using. For example, you should be able to:

* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate the website using just a keyboard
* listen to most of the website using a screen reader.

We aim to conform to the to the ‘AA’ standard of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. This is not just a legal requirement in the European Union, but a best practice that will enable as many people as possible to use the site.

## How to report problems

If you have any difficulties or annoyances using the site, or feel that we are not meeting accessibility requirements, then please contact us (webmaster@elixir-europe.org). We will do our best to make the site easier to use.

## How we assess the accessibility of the site

The BY-COVID project is a short-term, collaborative effort so unfortunately we do not have the resources to hire an accessibility expert. However, our community includes professional web developers, who assess the accessibility of the site using:

* [The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative checklist](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/)
* [The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
* [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
* [Accessibilitytest.org](https://accessibilitytest.org/), which runs several accessibility checkers at once.
* The website was last assessed on 12 October 2021.

## Level of compliance

The website currently scores 98/100 in Google Lighthouse and 88/100 in accessibilitytest.org. However, there are a smnall number of issues that affect WCAG Level A and AA compliance, mostly to do with the newsletter signup form provided by a third party. We are confident we can address these issues, however, and will do so by the end of 2021.


If you feel there are more issues to address, then please email ([webmaster@elixir-europe.org](mailto:webmaster@elixir-europe.org)).
