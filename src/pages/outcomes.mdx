BY-COVID runs from October 2021 to October 2024. The ultimate outcome of the project is that SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious disease data will be easier to access, share and analyse. This will enable the world to respond more quickly to infectious disease outbreaks. During the project there will also be specific outputs such as publications and deliverables. Deliverables will include reports and best practice guidelines. These outputs will appear here as the project progresses.
